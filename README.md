both configured with 
- UBL with fast probing of decent number of probe points
- ARC command support to eliminate stutter ofer serial connection
- a fast 500,000 baud serial connection appropriate for the 21st century
- input shaping with some plausible default frequencies
- linear advance with a plausible default K factor
- usable default PID parameters for the hotend
- bang-bang heating for the bed so your heater driver doesn't blow up
- host commands enabled for a joyous and fulfilling Octoprint experience
- some other s#!7 that I enabled but can't recall :P

that said, use at your own risk.  or you're own risk (whatever "grammer" 
may have taught you).
